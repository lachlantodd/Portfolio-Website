          This console application was created as the final submission to QUT's unit IFN564 Data Structures and Algorithms.
          The requirement was to create a console application using C# to digitally store and manage an inventory of tools using an appropriate data structure.
          I chose to store the tools in a tree data structure such that each tool was a child of its tool category, and each tool category was a child of the root node.
          Tools were stored with references to their first child and their next sibling, which were null if empty.
        </p>
        <p>
          A tree structure was chosen since it is dynamically sized.
          The assignment specification required functionality to add new tools so I decided this would be important.
          There is an obvious slight searching speed limitation since the tools are not stored adjacent in memory like in an array.
          I decided, however, that since the total number of tools would not be significantly large, the difference in search speed would be negligible.
        </p>
        <p>
          For adding new tools to the tree, a breadth-first approach to searching was used until the correct tool category was found.
          The category was then traversed until the new tool could be placed alphabetically.
          This ensured the tree was always alphabetically sorted without having to call any sorting methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          An array was used to store the data of the tool renters (an array of Renter objects).
          The array was chosen here for its speed and simplicity, allowing for searching by index to go back and forward through the array.
          The number of active renters is expected to grow and shrink rather simultaneously, as opposed to the number of tools only ever increasing over time.
          Because of this, I decided an array would structure with a large enough static limit would be appropriate.
